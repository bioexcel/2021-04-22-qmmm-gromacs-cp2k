## Instructions for connecting to ARCHER2

<p> Please try to complete the following setup tasks ahead of the
lesson.
</p>


### Get a SAFE account

First you need to register for a SAFE account - SAFE is our online 
administration system. Please ensure you use the same email address that you 
used to register for the course.

[https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk)

If you have an existing SAFE account for ARCHER or Tier2 systems, then use 
your existing SAFE login credentials to log in, rather than creating a new 
account.

### Set up a password-protected SSH key 

Instructions for setting up a password-protected SSH key for ARCHER2 can be 
found in the ARCHER2 documentations:

[https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#generating-and-adding-an-ssh-key-pair](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#generating-and-adding-an-ssh-key-pair) 

### Request your ARCHER2 login account.

You will need to request an account for project `ta025`. Instructions for 
requesting your ARCHER2 login account can be found here:

[https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#request-an-archer2-login-account](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#request-an-archer2-login-account)

You will receive an email once your account request has been approved and the account has been set up - there may be a delay.

You can then retrieve the initial password:

[https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#collecting-your-archer2-password](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#collecting-your-archer2-password)

and get logged on

[https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#login-to-archer2](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/quick-start/quickstart-users/#login-to-archer2)

Note that when you first log on you will be immediately prompted to change your 
“ldap password” – this is asking you to enter your temporary ARCHER2 password 
**again**.

### Problems 

If you have any issues, please contact the ARCHER2 service desk,
support@archer2.ac.uk, and mention that you are an attendee on the
QM/MM with GROMACS + CP2K course and are using the Training Project
ta025.
