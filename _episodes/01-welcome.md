## [Welcome](../slides/welcome.pdf)

[BioExcel Overview](../slides/BioExcel.pdf)

[BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu) is a European Centre of Excellence in
HPC applications for computational biomolecular research. Established
in 2015, the centre has grown into a major research and innovation hub
for scientific computing. BioExcel develops some of the most popular
applications for modelling and simulation of biomolecular systems. A
broad range of pre-/post-processing tools are integrated together with
the core applications within user-friendly workflows and container
solutions. The software stack comes with great performance and
scalability capabilities for extreme-scale utilization of the worlds
largest high-performance computing (HPC) and high-throughput computing
(HTC) compute resource. BioExcel has developed an extensive training
program to address competence gaps in extreme-scale scientific
computing for beginners, advanced users and HPC/HTC system
maintainers. The centre maintains an extensive and growing network of
industrial researchers in the pharmaceutical, chemical and food
industries, and offers tailored products and consultancy services,
while code development is done in close collaborations with hardware
and software vendors to ensure compatibility and support for
cutting-edge features. BioExcel works closely with various
governmental, non-profit, educational and policy projects and
initiatives.

[PRACE, ARCHER2](../slides/ARCHER2-PATC-Intro.pdf)

[PRACE](https://prace-ri.eu/) (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe)
aims to enable high-impact scientific discovery and engineering research and
development across disciplines to enhance European competitiveness for the
benefit of society. PRACE seeks to achieve this by offering world-class
computing and data management resources and services. PRACE currently has
members from 26 countries across Europe.

Along with providing access to HPC infractructures across Europe, PRACE provides
world-class HPC training for researchers in Europe through its six PRACE Advanced
Training Centres (PATCs). Information about PRACE training can be found
[here](https://prace-ri.eu/).
